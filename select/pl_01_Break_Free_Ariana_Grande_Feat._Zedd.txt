If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Try to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore
I only want to die alive
Never by the hands of
broken heart
I don't want to hear you
lie tonight
Now that I've become
who I really am
This is the part when
I say don't want ya
I'm stronger then
I've been before
This is the part when
I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when
I say don't want ya
I'm stronger then
I've been before
This is the part when
I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
You're better, deeper
I was under your spell, yeah
Like I didn't let feeling in me
On the highway to hell, yeah
I only want to die alive
Never by the hands of
broken heart
I don't want to hear you
lie tonight
Now that I've become
who I really am
This is the part when
I say don't want ya
I'm stronger then
I've been before
This is the part when
I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when
I say don't want ya
I'm stronger then
I've been before
This is the part when
I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
(No more, baby, ooh)
Finally I came alive
It was lethal
It was fatal
In my dreams it felt so right
But I woke up,
Every time
Oh baby!
This is the part when
I say don't want ya
I'm stronger then
I've been before
This is the part when
I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when
I say don't want ya
I'm stronger then
I've been before
This is the part when
I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
