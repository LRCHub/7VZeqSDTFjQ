[00:30.96] If you want it, take it
[00:34.98] I should have said it before
[00:37.99] Tried to hide it, fake it
[00:42.08] I can't pretend anymore
[00:53.58] 
[00:45.52] I only want to die alive
[00:49.02] Never by the hands of a broken heart
[00:53.48] I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
[00:56.28] Now that I've become who I really am
[01:14.28] 
[01:00.90] This is the part when I say I don't want ya
[01:06.10] I'm stronger than I've been before
[01:08.76] This is the part when I break free
[01:12.73] 'Cause I can't resist it no more
[01:28.73] 
[01:15.96] This is the part when I say I don't want ya
[01:20.62] I'm stronger than I've been before
[01:23.55] This is the part when I break free
[01:27.85] 'Cause I can't resist it no more
[01:43.85] 
[01:37.28] You were better, deeper
[01:41.37] I was under your spell
[01:44.36] Like a deadly fear I am, babe
[01:49.47] On the highway to hell
[02:00.47] 
[01:52.26] I only want to die alive
[01:55.62] Never by the hands of a broken heart
[01:59.41] I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
[02:02.95] Now that I've become who I really am
[02:20.95] 
[02:06.94] This is the part when I say I don't want ya
[02:12.38] I'm stronger than I've been before
[02:15.16] This is the part when I break free
[02:19.79] 'Cause I can't resist it no more
[02:35.79] 
[02:22.73] This is the part when I say I don't want ya
[02:26.99] I'm stronger than I've been before
[02:29.63] This is the part when I break free
[02:34.68] 'Cause I can't resist it no more
[02:50.68] 
[02:39.35] (No more baby, oooh)
[02:47.33] Thought of your body
[02:49.87] I came alive
[02:52.87] It was lethal
[02:54.65] It was fatal
[02:56.26] In my dreams it felt so right
[02:59.16] But I woke up every time
[03:11.16] 
[03:08.75] Oh baby
[03:11.06] This is the part when I say I don't want ya
[03:15.02] I'm stronger than I've been before
[03:18.19] This is the part when I break free
[03:22.33] 'Cause I can't resist it no more
[03:38.33] 
[03:25.25] This is the part when I say I don't want ya
[03:29.74] I'm stronger than I've been before
[03:32.68] This is the part when I break free
[03:37.03] 'Cause I can't resist it no more
